# Open Source Database Visualizer

This project aims to solve the problem of needing multiple database visualizers for each kind of database.
Having a MySQL database, one needs to use the WorkBench software. Similar to Oracle. Similar to PostgreSQL. Similar to MongoDB.
This project would allow the user to have a single place to visualize the databases by passing their credentials and other necessary information like port numbers, paths and so on.
Initially, the project shall start simply with MySQL.
Once an initial version is deployed, other additions for Oracle, PostgreSQL, and so on should be made.
The plan is also to support No-SQL databases in the future but the SQL databases will be prioritized and worked on first from my side.
